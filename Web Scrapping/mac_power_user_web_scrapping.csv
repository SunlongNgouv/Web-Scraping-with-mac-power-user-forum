Pre-covid that was mostly for the convenience of being able to use it when I grabbed a bite to eat or drink when out exercising. Nowadays, it is more about easily avoiding contact during payment.

I started listening to MPU from the very beginning by syncing the episodes from iTunes onto my iPod Classic back when I was still in middle school. And I‚Äôm still listening to MPU today - but now as a law student.

Back when the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù was invented, haha.I remember going on a 650km road trip listening to the first 7 episodes - I was late to the party', 'I don‚Äôt know what previous discussion there has been on the forum regarding Obsidian, but it is not the same as RoamResearch and shouldn‚Äôt be grouped with ‚Äúresearch‚Äù app‚Äôs. Obsidian is 100% a note-taking app and in no way attempts to be a clone of Roam, contrary to the comments of some out there.Using Obsidian over the last few months, it has replaced any thoughts I‚Äôve had of using Bear or Ulysses, etc. for note-taking and I have in the past used them all. Obsidian uses your nominated folder of markdown files, not a database of small data units that can be as easily manipulated and re-organised as blocks in Roam are.', 'You could use Obsidian for research, but it‚Äôs a note-taking app, whereas Roam is a better research app that you could use for note-taking‚Ä¶ big difference.', 'The interview with @MacMarty is golden. More of this please', 'As David mentioned it could really help if people had sent feedback to Apple.', 'It‚Äôs very annoying when you don‚Äôt know if the app have support for VoiceOver or not.', 'On that Apple TV √°udio source thing: you could just hold the play/pause button on the Home Screen and it will pop the audio source menu.', 'Second way to do it is, inside a movie, just swipe down and select audio. It will show there.', 'After consuming MPU #546, Focused #103 on Systems, and Bookworm #68 (again) on Taking Smart Notes, I began considering how to better pull together my many reading notes in Apple Notes into a collection in DevonThink 3 Pro to possibly build a digital slip box.  I discovered the share feature in Notes will allow me to send a single note to DT, but the are feature is greyed out/unavailable when multiple notes are selected.  I‚Äôm not doing 400+ notes individually.  Has anyone found a way to bulk transfer these notes to DT -and the bonus round would be getting DT to add tags from Notes.', 'Any ideas would be really appreciated!Dave', 'So it‚Äôs a long time since I‚Äôve used Live Scribe (I had one of the original ones which stopped being supported), but one of the best features for me was that you could record audio as well whilst taking notes and later you could go back and tap any point in your note and it would play the audio from when you were making the note. So, say you were following a lecturer explaining a concept or principle and your note didn‚Äôt make perfect sense when you looked back at it later, you could just ‚Äòtap‚Äô, and hear what was being said at the time.', 'Notability has some similar audio features, although I‚Äôve not used them so can‚Äôt really comment on any differences.', 'The text replacement multi-line sync tip in this episode was great. I am forced to use Outlook on iOS and am looking for a place to expand multiline text as a bandaid for TextExpander and getting multi-line support helps. To be clear, I am aware that TextExpander has an app on iOS, some mail clients do natively support it, and I can use the TE keyboard but, I just needed a simple solution for a couple multi-line text responses specifically in Outlook. Pasting the text into system preferences on the Mac worked as advertised.', 'Great episode. Regarding Stephen‚Äôs comments around the Yeti Blue microphone: I use this for videoconferencing and general recording and bought it at the time because I was under the impression that it was one of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (and it happened to be on sale). Is there a better microphone that you‚Äôd recommend? I‚Äôm not a professional podcaster or broadcaster, but I am looking for good quality for calls, teleconferencing, and the occasional video voiceover. Thanks!', 'Hi @Patch! I am not an expert so I will defer to those more experienced. I suspect that for your use case, the blue yeti is fine (I have the same mic and use it for the same things). But, you might also be interested in this thread: Entry level Microphones for podcasting', 'Thanks, @Brad! That was a useful thread. I guess I‚Äôll stick with the Yeti (which I have on a boom, by the way) until either my needs change or something better comes along.', 'One interesting note: I also have a Jabra wireless headset and I‚Äôve been told by others on conference calls that the sound is better through my Jabra mic than the Yeti, which seems to be rather hollow or echo-ey . That may be an issue with my home office ‚Äî I probably need to add some carpet and sound deadening materials.', 'My opinion for translating talk to podcast the Blue Yeti is excellent. If you not having problems keep using it. Typical problem with the mike is it‚Äôs sensitivity to sounds in the room. Example heater fans and traffic noise. Just depends on the environment.', 'I find that the attention paid to high quality mics doesn‚Äôt really translate to high quality podcasts. Content matters most; some of my favourite episodes across all my podcast listening have included people calling in on fuzzy phone lines.', 'Buying a fancy mic and XLR set-up before you‚Äôve developed a good show with an audience might be like buying the best running shoes because you‚Äôve decided to be a runner, even if you‚Äôve never run a race.', 'That said, some of the options look real nice‚Ä¶', 'Typical problem with the mike is it‚Äôs sensitivity to sounds in the room. Example heater fans and traffic noise. Just depends on the environment.', 'In home scenarios it is nearly impossible to eliminate room interference entirely so the first best option is to be in the best room in the house - clap your hands, listening for flutter reflections, and choose the room with the least echoes.', 'Then treat the room. You don‚Äôt need to buy expensive pre-made acoustic treatments, but some kind of treatment may be necessary for superior sound. A friend of mine is an actor and voice actor in L.A. and in order for her to do remote auditions with the best sound quality she bought heavy moving blankets and made a fort baffle of them surrounding her in a small room, the blankets held up by heavy-duty stands (I think she borrowed some C-stands from somewhere).', ""If your recording isn‚Äôt live you can use audio plugins like Izotope RX, which have specific voice-related modules (RX has ‚ÄòVoice De-Noise‚Äô and 'De-Reverb) which mitigates constant background noise."", 'Some electronics (refrigerators, hard drive, AC) impart noise too, so try to turn them off or get away from them.', 'I also have a Jabra wireless headset and I‚Äôve been told by others on conference calls that the sound is better through my Jabra mic than the Yeti', 'Finally, GET CLOSE TO THE MIC. One reason the Jabra mic might sound better is because you‚Äôre closer to that mic. Bring the Yeti to nearly the same distance and you will probably find the audio quality to be much better.', 'Great tips. Thanks, @bowline! I‚Äôve got some vacation time coming up next week and nowhere to go, so I‚Äôll take up the project of sound deadening my room (and practicing bring the mic closer).', 'Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled']"

This episode, David and Stephen walk through the features and tools you should know about.', 'Really informative episode.  Photo and photo management are really important to me.  Like Stephen, I have been using Finder only for years and it has served its purpose but I may be ready to try a different approach.  I used to use Google‚Äôs Picasa and I loved how that app would not screw with your own personal folder organization/structure, and how that app was just a better interface to handle photos.  I don‚Äôt feel the same with Apple Photos‚Ä¶yet.', 'Similar to David, I have a massive photo library/collection spanning 20 years now.  Similar to Stephen (maybe it‚Äôs the name  ), I need to be able to access the actual photo images/files (JPG) and as noted,  have been using Finder/Folders forever to organize photos by year and, in my case, event/activity.  I create annual photo books for the family and being able to dig into the actual photos is important.', 'The other thing that just frustrates me about Apple Photos is that I feel like I am handing over my photo life and putting my photos in a ‚Äòblack hole‚Äô since the Apple Photos organizes them on the ‚Äòback end‚Äô in such a nebulous method.   I basically need order and structure here.', 'I could write a few pages on different use cases where I need flexibility in my Photo manager and I won‚Äôt bore you with those.  To me, the big thing that I need to get past is giving up full control of my photo collection to Apple and this app.  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm there yet.', 'I was looking for this in the episode but to no avail, maybe wasn‚Äôt listening closely enough. When Stephen says he‚Äôs switching from DropBox to full Photo workflow, does it mean all RAW are now kept also inside Photo?', 'Just curious how people are dealing with it. Keeping all RAW in Photo, or only keeping the developed/edited JPG in Photo while having RAW stored somewhere else outside Photo?', 'When Stephen says he‚Äôs switching from DropBox to full Photo workflow, does it mean all RAW are now kept also inside Photo?', 'That‚Äôs how I read/heard it too.  And that is the rub that keeps me away from Apple Photos.', 'Apple Photos does give the option to keep your folder structure as you defined it (as I noted, I organize my pix by Year > Event/Activity) however by choosing that option in Preferences, the app does not then sync those photos with iCloud.  So basically, they are forcing you to push all your photos into their method of file organization.  For me, that‚Äôs a show stopper.  Can someone convince me I‚Äôm wrong and that I‚Äôm looking at this via a 2005 lens?', 'Any suggestions on how to keep ‚Äúfamily‚Äù photos in sync? If my wife and I go someplace we both take photos with our devices. It‚Äôs frustrating that we have to create shared albums and exchange photos with each other. It would be nice if there were a way to automatically share/sync photos.', 'Apple will tell you to use Shared Albums, but as they mention in the show, these are less than full resolution. What I want is a shared library from Apple. I get that not everyone will want to share all photos with a spouse, but my wife and I do. As I said on another thread, I‚Äôve been searching for a solution for 13 years! What I have cobbled together is that Dropbox on my wife‚Äôs iPhone autosyncs all her photos to a shared folder. Hazel on my Mac imports them into Photos, then moves them to my NAS (for just-in-case safekeeping). It‚Äôs not perfect (there are occasional hiccups related to duplicates and other issues), but in general it‚Äôs worked okay. I would prefer an iCloud based solution and, like the complaint about lack of more free iCloud storage, it is my perennial complaint/request.', 'I generally don‚Äôt keep RAW images around unless it‚Äôs really special, in which case JPGs will go in Photos and RAW on an external drive or something.', 'I‚Äôve bought the Field Guide mainly for my wife, and have turned on iCloud for her photos across her iPhone and iMac. However it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. I had used Aperture with photos external in a directory hierarchy, just buying into having it manage the photos just when Apple dropped Aperture! So I‚Äôve moved to Lightroom.

However, I think the situation is that Apple Photos (Desktop) and Apple Photos (iOS) are not connecting the dots that I first added those photos via iMac Desktop version of Apple Photos, which then synced with iCloud and added them to iOS Apple Photos.', 'I‚Äôve had Photos and iCloud sync for them for a while, but I only had the Mac set to use it, as a backup. I also stored all my photos in a Year/Month folder structure within finder, as well as Photos. iPhone photos were uploaded to my Mac using Photosync, with HEIC files put in to Photos and JPG copies of them put in to finder.', 'However, going through the field guide, I‚Äôve not gone all in with Photos, and have now created a smart album to have an album created that lists all images added to Photos since last date - I‚Äôll then export these and Hazal will sort for me in to the finder backup for me.', 'I have made sure to turn off Dropbox uploading and Photosync, as these will upload the thumbnail images from the camera roll, as I have optimise phone storage turn on.', 'And on top of that, the photos put into a shared photo are ordered by when the photo was added, not taken.

Topics include email services, apps and strategies. Later in the show, they are joined by Rosemary Orchard and Myke Hurley to hear about two specific apps they use every day.', 'Let me know what you think about the embedded mini-interviews!', 'It‚Äôs a great way to get perspective from experienced users who know more about the topic without having them join the whole show. Side note, at 46:04 & 51:23, I think @RosemaryOrchard meant Airmail instead of Airtable.', 'Great episode. I‚Äôm disappointed that you fell into the trap of so many In the Apple community of only looking deeply at four email apps - Apple Mail, Gmail, Airmail, and Spark. Outlook should be in the top two or three apps heavily discussed in these type of setting (I remember the days when David would spend weeks testing apps to recommend the best option). In my opinion, Outlook is right up there with rivaling Apple Mail as the most stable email app, and is available for any type of email you throw in it. It doesn‚Äôt creepily store your emails on their own server like Spark, which is a no go for my work IT department and for me after Edison Mail became the latest to exposure sensitive user data from their servers. Finally, the features are great. Snoozing, really fine Do Not Disturb and Notification Controls per account, VIP flags pulled into separate folders for your most important Senders, and a built in virtual assist (Cortana) that will read you emails and let you act on them solely through voice to set up tasks, schedule meetings, and set time to work on a response. I‚Äôm surprised so many Apple fans ignore it just because it‚Äôs made by Microsoft - it may be the best email app on iOS.', 'I liked the mini interviews. I think Myke‚Äôs was the first time I‚Äôve heard someone talk about Spark for Teams. Sounds like a perfect use case.', 'That‚Äôs how it goes, Justin. The Mac Power Users seem to be a bit short sighted when it comes to applications (and guests). Besides Outlook there are also Postbox and MailMate as really powerful mail clients. All more than viable alternatives.', 'As for Outlook, one of the main shortcomings is the lack of cardDAV/calDAV integration. So for non-Office365 users it‚Äôs hard to get access to their contacts and calendars.', 'I‚Äôd thought that this would be the rare podcast with Rosemary Orchard that didn‚Äôt mention Airtable. I needn‚Äôt have worried.', 'The best iOS email client is Preside, but it never seems to rate a mention. The app is brilliant. Along with MailMate on Mac, all my email needs are taken care of.', 'How come I never heard about it?  It even has IMAP keywords. Thanks for the heads up. I will definitely check it out.', 'Update: Unfortunately it‚Äôs a subscription app. I think I‚Äôll stick with Mail.', 'I somehow never heard of Mailmate until a few months ago (maybe because it rarely comes up on MPU), and I‚Äôm puzzled about why it doesn‚Äôt get a serious look. It seems like it‚Äôs literally the kind of app that Mac power users would most want. If it were mentioned and dismissed as ‚Äútoo ugly‚Äù or ‚Äútoo fiddly,‚Äù I‚Äôd understand that. But I don‚Äôt remember any extended discussion of Mailmate in the past. (Maybe I‚Äôm forgetting it.)', 'For those who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs screaming fast ‚Äî noticeably faster than any other mail client I‚Äôve tried for the Mac, and it‚Äôs almost infinitely customizable with smart rules, smart folders, etc.', 'Based on my experience with it, I‚Äôm about to download Preside for iOS, another app I‚Äôve never heard of.', 'I also loved the interviews. It was a perfect implementation. Myke‚Äôs description of Spark for Teams is the best case for it I‚Äôve ever heard. And I think we all know that @RosemaryOrchard is only a small nudge away from literally building an email client that operates entirely inside Airtable.', 'I‚Äôm surprised so many Apple fans ignore it just because it‚Äôs made by Microsoft - it may be the best email app on iOS.', 'Could be the bad reputation it got when first released. MS purchased it from Acompli and it was still storing login credentials on 3rd party servers when they release their version.  That got it banned by a lot of companies.', 'Just installed Preside. WHAT THE HECK??!!', '@Drewster This was a great recommendation. At least so far. It seems a lot like the Mailmate sensibility: let the user decide how to set it up and use it.', '@vco1 There‚Äôs a premium subscription, but unless I misunderstand, what I‚Äôm seeing on my phone after setup is already way more powerful than Mail, so unless they‚Äôve figured out a way to implement a trial, I think it‚Äôs worth a look.', 'Shocked to hear that you guys have had positive experiences with Apple Mail‚Äôs search. At our agency it was the reason we switched to Gmail last year. I would get completely different results on different Macs with the same IMAP settings on the same account. Some days I could find stuff, some days I had to manually dig. It was infuriating.', 'I wish Gmail had a proper client, but it‚Äôs just so good in Chrome. Pair it with Zapier and it‚Äôs really powerful.', 'Mailmate was in a section of the mail episode we cut for time, but we‚Äôl be talking more about it in next week‚Äôs feedback episode.', 'I thought Outlook got enough discussion. I would have called it the best iOS mail client a few years ago (it was introduced to me as such.) It‚Äôs still a nice looking client with a good focus view, integrated calendar and O365 integration. Power users whose companies don‚Äôt use O365 can be more productive on other apps, in my opinion.', 'I actually tried to make Outlook work for me on Mac, and my gripe with it was that it ignored the system integrations in favor of its own.', 'So it would (for example) see a calendar event, and offer to add it to my calendar - then it would add it to some calendar internal to Outlook rather than my Apple calendar. Same with contacts.', 'I realize there are probably ways to try to get these things to sync, but I think it‚Äôs a little crazy that a Mac application can‚Äôt put something on the native Mac calendar - or into the Mac contacts list. The added friction is what got me to uninstall Outlook.', 'So it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs made by Microsoft - it‚Äôs because Microsoft is a poor platform citizen in some regards.', 'The subscription is totally optional. I paid because I liked it so much but even the developer states that the app is essentially donationware.', 'Enjoyed the episode!', 'I think it‚Äôs important to make a PSA to recommend that people turn off image loading by default in their mail apps.', 'That feature is exploited for tracking, which can let bad actors know that you received and viewed the email they sent, which tells them you‚Äôre an attractive target. Don‚Äôt be attractive! (That‚Äôs easier to do with quarantine hair‚Ä¶)', 'By way of follow up, here‚Äôs my review of MailMate.', 'And this review by Bryce Wray on Preside.', 'I agree.
