app s obsidian is a note take app and in no way attempt to be a clone of roam contrari to the comment of some out there use obsidian over the last few month it ha replac ani thought i ve had of use bear or ulyss etc for note take and i have in the past use them all obsidian use your nomin folder of markdown file not a databas of small data unit that can be a easili manipul and re organis a block in roam are you could use obsidian for research but it s a note take app wherea roam is a better research app that you could use for note take big differ the interview with macmarti is golden more of thi plea a david mention it could realli help if peopl had sent feedback to appl it s veri annoy when you don t know if the app have support for voiceov or not on that appl tv áudio sourc thing you could just hold the play paus button on the home screen and it will pop the audio sourc menu second way to do it is insid a movi just swipe down and select audio it will show there after consum mpu

transfer these note to dt and the bonu round would be get dt to add tag from note ani idea would be realli appreci dave so it s a long time sinc i ve use live scribe i had one of the origin one which stop be support but one of the best featur for me wa that you could record audio a well whilst take note and later you could go back and tap ani point in your note and it would play the audio from when you were make the note so say you were follow a lectur explain a concept or principl and your note didn t make perfect sen when you look back at it later you could just tap and hear what wa be said at the time notabl ha some similar audio featur although i ve not use them so can t realli comment on ani differ the text replac multi line sync tip in thi episod wa great i am forc to use outlook on io and am look for a place to expand multilin text a a bandaid for textexpand and get multi line support help to be clear i am awar that textexpand ha an app on io some mail client do nativ

regard stephen s comment around the yeti blue microphon i use thi for videoconferenc and gener record and bought it at the time becaus i wa under the impress that it wa one of the best and it happen to be on sale is there a better microphon that you d recommend i m not a profession podcast or broadcast but i am look for good qualiti for call teleconferenc and the occasion video voiceov thank hi patch i am not an expert so i will defer to those more experienc i suspect that for your use case the blue yeti is fine i have the same mic and use it for the same thing but you might also be interest in thi thread entri level microphon for podcast thank brad that wa a use thread i guess i ll stick with the yeti which i have on a boom by the way until either my need chang or someth better come along one interest note i also have a jabra wireless headset and i ve been told by other on confer call that the sound is better through my jabra mic than the yeti which seem to be rather hollow or echo ey that may be an issu with my home offic i probabl need to add some carpet and sound deaden materi my opinion for translat talk to podcast the blue yeti is excel if you not have problem keep use it typic problem with the mike is it s sensit to sound in the room exampl heater fan and traffic nois just depend on the environ i find that the attent paid to high qualiti mic doesn t realli translat to high qualiti podcast content matter most some of my favourit episod across all my podcast listen have includ peopl call in on fuzzi phone line buy a fanci mic and xlr set up befor you ve develop a good show with an audienc might be like buy the best run shoe becaus you ve decid to be a runner even if you ve never run a race that said some of the option look real nice typic problem with the mike is it s sensit to sound in the room exampl heater fan and traffic nois just depend on the environ in home scenario it is nearli imposs to elimin room interfer entir so the first best option is to be in the best room in the hous clap your hand listen for flutter reflect and choos the room with the least echo then treat the room you don t need to buy expens pre made acoust treatment but some kind of treatment may be necessari for superior sound a friend of mine is an actor and voic actor in l a and in order for her to do remot audit with the best sound qualiti she bought heavi move blanket and made a fort baffl of them surround her in a small room the blanket held up by heavi duti stand i think she borrow some c stand from somewher if your record isn t live you can use audio plugin like izotop rx which have specif voic relat modul rx ha voic de nois and de reverb which mitig constant background nois some electron refriger hard drive ac impart nois too so tri to turn them off or get away from them i also have a jabra wireless headset and i ve been told by other on confer call that the sound is better through my jabra mic than the yeti final get close to the mic one reason the jabra mic might sound better is becaus you re closer to that mic bring the yeti to nearli the same distanc and you will probabl find the audio qualiti to be much better great tip thank bowlin i ve got some vacat time come up next week and nowher to go so i ll take up the project of sound deaden my room and practic bring the mic closer power by discours best view with javascript enabl \n",

purpos but i may be readi to tri a differ approach i use to use googl s picasa and i love how that app would not screw with your own person folder organ structur and how that app wa just a better interfac to handl photo i don t feel the same with appl photo yet similar to david i have a massiv photo librari collect span year now similar to stephen mayb it s the name i need to be abl to access the actual photo imag file jpg and a note have been use finder folder forev to organ photo by year and in my case event activ i creat annual photo book for the famili and be abl to dig into the actual photo is import the other thing that just frustrat me about appl photo is that i feel like i am hand over my photo life and put my photo in a black hole sinc the appl photo organ them on the back end in such a nebul method i basic need order and structur here i could write a few page on differ use case where i need flexibl in my photo manag and i won t bore you with those to me the big thing that i need to get past is give up full control of my photo collect to appl and thi app i don t know if i m there yet i wa look for thi in the episod but to no avail mayb wasn t listen close enough when stephen say he s switch from dropbox to full photo workflow doe it mean all raw are now kept also insid photo just curiou how peopl are deal with it keep all raw in photo or onli keep the develop edit jpg in photo while have raw store somewher el outsid photo when stephen say he s switch from dropbox to full photo workflow doe it mean all raw are now kept also insid photo that s how i read heard it too and that is the rub that keep me away from appl photo appl photo doe give the option to keep your folder structur a you defin it a i note i organ my pix by year event activ howev by choos that option in prefer the app doe not then sync those photo with icloud so basic they are forc you to push all your photo into their method of file organ for me that s a show stopper can someon convinc me i m wrong and that i m look at thi via a len ani suggest on how to keep famili photo in sync if my wife and i go someplac we both take photo with our devic it s frustrat that we have to creat share album and exchang photo with each other it would be nice if there were a way to automat share sync photo appl will tell you to use share album but a they mention in the show these are le than full resolut what i want is a share librari from appl i get that not everyon will want to share all photo with a spous but my wife and i do a i said on anoth thread i ve been search for a solut for year what i have cobbl togeth is that dropbox on my wife s iphon autosync all her photo to a share folder hazel on my mac import them into photo then move them to my na for just in case safekeep it s not perfect there are occasion hiccup relat to duplic and other issu but in gener it s work okay i would prefer an icloud base solut and like the complaint about lack of more free icloud storag it is my perenni complaint request i gener don t keep raw imag around unless it s realli special in which case jpg will go in photo and raw on an extern drive or someth i ve bought the field guid mainli for my wife and have turn on icloud for her photo across her iphon and imac howev it just doesn t work for me i had use apertur with photo extern in a directori hierarchi just buy into have it manag the photo just when appl drop apertur so i ve move to lightroom to handl sync from my iphon i had been use icloud photo stream which seem to be unment in the field guid at least a far a we ve gotten but now use adob s cloud to transfer with lightroom on the iphon it s still a terribl mess pictur from here photo and my lightroom have to be manual export and transfer to my server comput where they are typic shown use plex i will have to take a look at thi option i suppos then we will have copi of her photo but at least she can see them all in one place then i also use and like houdahgeo and i find use my iphon a a tracker to be so conveni a to be worth the extra batteri use the onli bummer is that one in ten trip the app stop record so you re back to guesstim where each photo wa taken what is best practic re backup photo if one doesn t have a mac but sole io ipado so i ad a coupl of folder from my finder folder base photo collect to appl photo via my imac to sort of dip my toe in the water with appl photo i then let them sync with icloud a note in the episod and they eventu found their way to my io photo app so all good a note in the epsisod love the photo discoveri tool embed in appl photo howev when i then connect my iphon to my imac via lightn cabl to charg my phone appl photo on desktop imac now want to import from my iphon io photo into my desktop appl photo all the photo that i origin ad to desktop appl photo via finder essent tri to add hundr of photo alreadi in appl photo is thi how it work thi make no sen is there a set that need to be adjust that i am miss will thi be a never end cycl if i add more of my finder base photo collect to appl photo if so thi is terribl ux terribl time groke all of thi myself and stick with other approach howev three thought com_bjango_istatmenus_combined_and_item kb ye i am align with you on all of those point i do not have that box check i have not click the import button a for the alreadi import indic what you re say wa my thought too howev i think the situat is that appl photo desktop and appl photo io are not connect the dot that i first ad those photo via imac desktop version of appl photo which then sync with icloud and ad them to io appl photo i ve had photo and icloud sync for them for a while but i onli had the mac set to use it a a backup i also store all my photo in a year month folder structur within finder a well a photo iphon photo were upload to my mac use photosync with heic file put in to photo and jpg copi of them put in to finder howev go through the field guid i ve not gone all in with photo and have now creat a smart album to have an album creat that list all imag ad to photo sinc last date i ll then export these and hazal will sort for me in to the finder backup for me i have made sure to turn off dropbox upload and photosync a these will upload the thumbnail imag from the camera roll a i have optimis phone storag turn on and on top of that the photo put into a share photo are order by when the photo wa ad not taken unless i m not see an option to chang thi i find thi to be banana it kill me macsparki i just want to say thank for the great job you did on the photo field

work with her thank kirk thi one took much longer to put togeth than you d think one thing i m still confus about with photo on icloud is it absolut necessari to forev maintain a paid icloud account with enough storag for all your photo video and a our collect grow over time need to pay increment more to appl everi month forev i don t might a reason fee for a cloud storag servic but perman grow lock in price is not ok you can initi select sync from your mac not io it is not a promin or obviou featur a reader want to reduc her icloud photo librari size a she s run out of her purchas storag

join the whole show side note at i think rosemaryorchard meant airmail instead of airtabl great episod i m disappoint that you fell into the trap of so mani in the appl commun of onli look deepli at four email app appl mail gmail airmail and spark outlook should be in the top two or three app heavili discus in these type of set i rememb the day when david would spend week test app to recommend the best option in my opinion outlook is right up there with rival appl mail a the most stabl email app and is avail for ani type of email you throw in it it doesn t creepili store your email on their own server like spark which is a no go for my work it depart and for me after edison mail becam the latest to exposur sensit user data from their server final the featur are great snooz realli fine do not disturb and notif control per account vip flag pull into separ folder for your most import sender and a built in virtual assist cortana that will read you email and let you act on them sole through voic to set up task schedul meet and set time to work on a respons i m surpris so mani appl fan ignor it just becaus it s made by microsoft it may be the best email app on io i like the mini interview i think myke s wa the first time i ve heard someon talk about spark for team sound like a perfect use case that s how it goe justin the mac power user seem to be a bit short sight when it come to applic and guest besid outlook there are also postbox and mailmat a realli power mail client all more than viabl altern a for outlook one of the main shortcom is the lack of carddav caldav integr so for non offic user it s hard to get access to their contact and calendar i d thought that thi would be the rare podcast with rosemari orchard that didn t mention airtabl i needn t have worri the best io email client is presid but it never seem to rate a mention the app is brilliant along with mailmat on mac all my email need are taken care of how come i never heard about it it even ha imap keyword thank for the head up i will definit check it out updat unfortun it s a subscript app i think i ll stick with mail i somehow never heard of mailmat until a few month ago mayb becaus it rare come up on mpu and i m puzzl about whi it doesn t get a seriou look it seem like it s liter the kind of app that mac power user would most want if it were mention and dismiss a too ugli or too fiddli i d understand that but i don t rememb ani extend discus of mailmat in the past mayb i m forget it for those who don t know it s scream fast notic faster than ani other mail client i ve tri for the mac and it s almost infinit customiz with smart rule smart folder etc base on my experi with it i m about to download presid for io anoth app i ve never heard of i also love the interview it wa a perfect implement myke s descript of spark for team is the best case for it i ve ever heard and i think we all know that rosemaryorchard is onli a small nudg away from liter build an email client that oper entir insid airtabl i m surpris so mani appl fan ignor it just becaus it s made by microsoft it may be the best email app on io could be the bad reput it got when first releas m purchas it from acompli and it wa still store login credenti on rd parti server when they releas their version that got it ban by a lot of compani just instal presid what the heck drewster thi wa a great recommend at least so far it seem a lot like the mailmat sensibl let the user decid how to set it up and use it vco there s a premium subscript but unless i misunderstand what i m see on my phone after setup is alreadi way more power than mail so unless they ve figur out a way to implement a trial i think it s worth a look shock to hear that you guy have had posit experi with appl mail s search at our agenc it wa the reason we switch to gmail last year i would get complet differ result on differ mac with the same imap set on the same account some day i could find stuff some day i had to manual dig it wa infuri i wish gmail had a proper client but it s just so good in chrome pair it with zapier and it s realli power mailmat wa in a section of the mail episod we cut for time but we l be talk more about it in next week s feedback episod i thought outlook got enough discus i would have call it the best io mail client a few year ago it wa introduc to me a such it s still a nice look client with a good focu view integr calendar and o integr power user whose compani don t use o can be more product on other app in my opinion i actual tri to make outlook work for me on mac and my gripe with it wa that it ignor the system integr in favor of it own so it would for exampl see a calendar event and offer to add it to my calendar then it would add it to some calendar intern to outlook rather than my appl calendar same with contact i realiz there are probabl way to tri to get these thing to sync but i think it s a littl crazi that a mac applic can t put someth on the nativ mac calendar or into the mac contact list the ad friction is what got me to uninstal outlook so it s not becaus it s made by microsoft it s becaus microsoft is a poor platform citizen in some regard the subscript is total option i paid becaus i like it so much but even the develop state that the app is essenti donationwar enjoy the episod i think it s import to make a psa to recommend that peopl turn off imag load by default in their mail app that featur is exploit for track which can let bad actor know that you receiv and view the email they sent which tell them you re an attract target don t be attract that s easier to do with quarantin hair by way of follow up here s my review of mailmat and thi review by bryce wray on presid i agre both with your evalu of appl mail search it s worthless and gmail in chrome welcom

touch enabl maco power the ipad with iphon ipad app come to arm mac unmodifi i think there s a bigger case for at least basic touch support on the mac i don t think maco is go to absorb the ipad if anyth they re meet in the middl more and more the immedi case is to bring the ui design languag close enough that io app don t look like alien invad i think a touch screen mac would need to come with more physic accommod imagin if the imac stole microsoft s surfac studio draft tabl mode i still agre that just put a touch screen on a pc display is a poor experi which is whi the window all in one that did thi have kind of die out i don t think maco is go to absorb the ipad if anyth they re meet in the middl more and more i ve long expect that an arm ibook should be the equival of a window foldabl notebook that also ran io app in a dual boot mode attach keyboard trackpad and touchscreen with a few tweak to maco to allow basic touch gestur onli like scroll and zoom while offer a full io experi but thi is not appar what appl is promis i also expect armac to be lock down to app store app onli which appear to be wrong too the question is what kind of io app would be allow to be use on an armac if there isn t touch support and how these unmodifi app that s what appl said they d be would work if they depend on touch we don t have the whole stori and so far appl is just tea the basic

the transit to arm is done in two year with all new product have arm chip there will still be million of intel mac run up to date oper system for year to come we tout how long our mac can last a one

catalyst app for the benefit of compet in a market they may well have no experi in while the altern is have their app simpli run on new mac just becaus legaci intel mac will continu to exist doesn t mean that ani new io app port over will succeed especi if there are exist nativ app in that space most io dev around the world aren t mac dev the mac market is much tinier than the io market and the intel mac market is go to shrink and a not insignific percentag of peopl stick with old er machin will plausibl be resist to buy new app either becaus they don t have the fund or they don t want to

you but i find it clunki and more suit to screenplay and novel then profession brief write i haven t tri ulyss but i understand that it is more of a write repositori than a basi for thi kind of project mayb an episod just on writer and differ type of write legal fiction poetri academ and the tool they use would be a cool episod kind of like the format use in the develop discus a summari of

enough to be sustain especi with a nich audienc i also like tower but i don t use it enough to justifi the year subscript price so i ve stuck with version which had a singl purchas licens and which doe everyth that i need thi seem like someth that could be emul with hazel each time the file chang save it with a date time append mayb into a hidden folder to be honest the reason i didn t ever realli use it even though i own it wa that i get day s worth of undo from dropbox almost all of my file are in dropbox i can t recal ever wish that i could go further back in time than what dropbox offer me dropbox larg just work and draft control often didn t keep a copi everi time you save is fine if you re work with small text file but if you re work with someth larg and complex you wouldn t want to duplic it on each save git and program like it are abl to save just the differ between chang which is much more effici you d probabl find that everi save is actual too often in most case what you realli want is more like everi paragraph or everi page if you chang a word save then wrote a sentenc save again then re wrote it and save again you might want each of those version but you might not the troubl is it s hard to know until you re in the thick of it for some document you might realli onli want to save a version of it each time you close the file and finish work on it for the day agre i just saw an editor with infinit undo can t recal which icloud ha version too though i don t have occas to use it i keep everyth import except binari data in git repo if you chang a word save then wrote a sentenc save again then re wrote it and save again thi would be a good indic that you re use word yeah in fact i have never found it necessari to have more than the end of the day s version and not much use of that realli sometim i think it is a case of u follow the capabl of the technolog rather than vice versa i did form my write habit on hard copi i admit i find i have realli develop new habit sinc it form sentenc on the screen rather than in my head i might put it i don t need prior version for that though i just keep correct a paragraph or sentenc at a time and never need previou version my first paper though wa done on word i think year ago i do write better electron i think and did from the get go howev that one wa a kind of fight with word softwar a i rememb it

month ago the origin price wa i found thi that look similar minimalist keyboard for comput tablet and phone featur easi switch i am use a logitech k that i can switch between three devic i hardli use it k multi devic keyboard let you type on ani bluetooth devic that support extern keyboard learn more i have been look for a good home camera setup i have two of these and use them all the time super use when switch between ipad and multipl mac shame that the discontinu but i think the one jason_papavasilei post below is their new version i m just here for the free pas to hate on facebook i m wonder whi secur camera on homekit are use is there a servic in particular they offer or do the camera just show an imag on the homekit screen there are a great mani on site surveil record system avail and some of them allow access from outsid your network appropri secur in place obvious i have one and have been care where i place my drink glass ever sinc i learn they have been discontinu thank for point out the post about the k i m wonder whi secur camera on homekit are use there are a great mani on site surveil record system avail and mani of them have aw secur foscam camera were found to have had a hardcod blackfoot password with littl support after sale and can be crack or control for use in botnet even if they re okay now they could get crack later and mani have clumsi secur configur that user don t manag properli better cam have fa and are updat regularli a need you re not go to get that with a ip wyze camera whose video feed is provid through a chine compani you ve never heard of mani compani like ring have term of servic allow them to use your data video pas it on to author or be view by them without permiss becaus of appl s stanc on privaci and secur thi is

pro i still have the old smart folio case model but the camera cut out is annoy i would like the magic keyboard but is not an option right now there s also the k i have that ha multi devic switch http www techspot com product keyboard logitech k wireless multi devic quiet desktop keyboard i don t like the feel of type on it that much though which is disappoint the round key shape isn t a comfort a more squar key for me and the mechan doesn t bring me joy i mean it s fine but it s not a good a the keyboard i have at work and i miss it i have the k in the offic http www logitech com en gb product k keyboard and i absolut love type on that but it s a littl too wide and i find my mous hand drift too far off to the side for ergonom comfort the biggest issu is it isn t a multi devic switch model and you have to use the usb unifi receiv which isn t go to work with my ipad so it s not a good home keyboard option for me i wa go to get the mx key http www logitech com en gb product mx key wireless keyboard but it wa out of stock everywher when i wa buy a keyboard to work at home and it also ha that too wide problem for me a well a a fix angl with it be rais at the back instead of be

mythic quest for all mankind morn show and dickinson are my favorit wa surpris that mythic quest didn t get a shout out sinc it s my favorit show on the servic a per copi substitut i ve been use past

to switch even though i agre that it seem to be abandonewar i like the text transform on the mac my finger know the app veri well and on the iphon it s great for those late night session where i cruis reddit and tumblr look for retro ad and old photo and post a lot of my find to micro blog and social medium the one big except to my overal continu satisfact with copi sync between my mac iphon and ipad is badli broken alway ha been for me thi ha not proven to be a dealbreak at some point i ll probabl explor option or at least look into figur out whi sync won t work i realli enjoy thi episod and the whole state of appl in seri regard the dropbox v icloud drive debat one thing that keep me on dropbox is that some of the shortcut file action remain sandbox in the shortcut folder on icloud drive wherea select dropbox allow me to save file anywher without have to choos the destin folder manual each time i hope that io ipado will fix thi copi em past is not cheap but it offer screenshot text transform save favorit favorit folder transform drag and drop imag out to prefer imag format and more i ve been use it for year syncabl io app is current in beta too paid for itself mani time over one

plea do the show on email app that you mention in thi episod i agre with david that there isn t an ideal mail app i jump from appl mail to airmail to spark and mayb anoth or along the way and move on becaus of some frustrat that pop up i have account in icloud gmail yahoo for a total of probabl account i d like to know what other think also speak of browser that could be a show i haven t check to

app if it s the onli tab that s open give me fix width unless there are too mani to accommod them the other is no option to close all tab to the right i use thi all the time oh yeah extens or lack thereof in safari is a big drawback a far a clipboard copi em past work well it s mac but there s an io app in testflight i ve had veri good luck with that app move clip between platform a coupl of thought toni it wa interest to hear that appl note use it own synchron technolog perhap thi explain whi there isn t more pressur to fix some of the odder littl synchron issu that have persist so long although lose your folder structur doesn t feel so littl i wa the one who post about use text expand to do multi line text replac on io my minut of fame so if one open text replac on the mac and unfold a multi line snippet into it then it sync a a multi line snippet to io which is sadli otherwis imposs to do on the mac or io multi line text replac i am sure it will be ad within the decad i wish ismh and macsparki had more signific experi with spotifi i think they may have a lesser opinion of appl music base on how awesom spotifi s discoveri engin is and how appl music s is sever lack i ve switch over for multipl reason to appl music but i ve given up on use their discoveri engin in find actual new music becaus of how disappoint their recommend are i m in a slack with a bunch of music fan who are split between the two servic and everyon on am say the same thing about how bad their discoveri engin is and it more the integr with everyth el is whi we use it i would agre with appl music be a b close to an a but my biggest issu is the featur pariti from the mac to io i would love to see smart playlist creation on io i agre spotifi is better at it discoveri ux on the homepag initi view i don t think it actual recommend are better although spotifi s higher volum of recommend give it more room to be diverg at the expens of confid in the pick it s hard to close compar sinc

function is good wysiwyg creation and edit support for unlimit stave unlimit score length a plug in architectur and good look notat it s no sibeliu or final but it s the best free altern i saw when i check it out a coupl of year ago http musescor org if you onli need short term access the best of breed sibeliu can be rent for month with academ discount when applic i don t believ musescor ha an ipad app that allow composit i use notion for ipad notat creat and edit it is ok it isn t anywher near a power a a desktop notat program but it can work in a pinch one advantag is that it can be use in conjunct with notion for mac so you can edit file across devic anoth newer option in the space is staffpad i have not tri it yet although i am tempt it is significantli more expens than notion but ha the advantag of be specif design for tablet use and is reliant good or bad on handwrit input dr david did an excel review on scoringnot com musescor which bowlin mention is not avail for ipad the best option on ipad are notion symphoni pro or staffpad none of these is a good a a pro option but they re the best avail for ipad for a mac musescor is a good start point but the onli way to get profession result is to use a pricey paid applic i use both dorico and sibeliu but final is also more than capabl of great score now i wish i could chang my usernam to dr david here i don t believ musescor ha an ipad app that allow composit you re right i now see that the ipad app onli allow view sheet music and chang tempo and transpos never compos sheet music on io but i knew musescor had io

danish classic music label on the side and classic and opera is a big passion of mine but i never wrote or practis music myself but after listen to your episod i thought it might be fun to do some composit on the ipad pro and then hear the result of it which of those composit app would you recommend to someon who ha a veri basic knowledg of music but can follow a score of a classic piec and just want to play around with classic music composit for fun and then listen to it afterward and build it from there i think you could start with notion and then if you feel like you want someth more you can tri someth a littl more fulli featur if you re open to work on a mac i think musescor is a better option the best option on ipad are notion symphoni pro or staffpad none of these is a good a a

            " state of the ipad in the last decad the ipad ha gone from a brand new devic into a wide reach line of product that meet the need of a rang of user thi week stephen and david talk about the current state of the platform how doe the ipad fit into your workflow and tech life after listen to thi episod i blew the metaphor dust off my ipad mini model not sure if i ll continu use it it s cramp and doesn t hold a charg long still i do like the light weight and how easi it is to hold mayb a macsparki say for read a a journalist my work take me to a lot of profession confer where i do interview take note on present and write articl i found last year that the ipad wa fine for that function pair with an extern keyboard i had to cut a few corner but that wa more than offset by light weight and long batteri life i still carri the macbook pro with me when i travel but it stay in my hotel room i ve mention thi befor but i m a huge fan of the base ipad and bought one for myself i do feel like if the ipad is someon s main signific devic for work then get the air or pro is worthwhil but i also strongli believ that the base ipad should be the default option for most peopl it is wonder fast for everyth i do on it with graphic and sketchup viewer probabl be the most demand one of the great thing about the common percept that the ipad is overpow is that year old processor are still veri capabl look forward to thi one a an ipad first user i use a pro and mini in my day to day edit podcast blog note take edit photo read colour consum i do of my day on an ipad outsid of have to use a window pc in work of cours lol i got the ipad within day of it releas in and it s still the one i use it is and alway ha been a reader i save articl to instapap all week and then i read most of them on the ipad later usual on the weekend i also use it to read the occasion book in appl book the onli time it s involv in work creation is when i use it dure voiceov gig a a script reader the o stop updat around someth but i haven t realli notic a long a instapap book and someth that can open word document keep work it s a good a new i ve been a bit of a crossroad recent but in a good way i use my origin ipad pro a my daili driver for work in lab becaus it s great for the two thing i need it for daili read research pdf and take note for onlin storag of my day to day lab life howev the lack of a good citat manag applic that isn t total crap in order to write paper and the inabl to run statist softwar like spss keep me from go all in on the devic for all my need the crossroad part is that i realli want to get a new laptop but cough up k for a new mbp isn t particularli entic and it would definit need to be with the new keyboard a my mbp need replac befor i gave up on it ipad doe a lot of thing that i need but not the two major role that i need it to perform becaus of specif softwar packag so at thi stage it will remain a side devic and not a main comput would the apponfli implement of ibm spss work for you http www apponfli com en ibm spss statist standard i think appl ha approach incorrectli their messag with the ipad they promot that it can be a laptop replac a mistak who want to replac someth that actual work it is my opinion that they should have focus on promot whi the ipad is the best option to do some key task it can replac activ that you do on a macbook but if you need or want a macbook buy a macbook an ipad is perfect and more enjoy to use for some task but it is more limit than a macbook have an ipad allow you to be quicker and portabl but even with the great improv you are limit by the softwar you can do mani task quicker on an ipad than a macbook but other you simpli cannot or are quit slow and clumsi even if i consid myself a pro user of the ipad i need my macbook when go mobil mostli it stay on the bag but i still need it to be product i cannot depend on the ipad i first had an ipad then the origin ipad pro the larg one and now a new ipad pro over the year i have heard david and kati and stephen talk about the appl pencil and they alway leav out one huge categori of user for whom the pencil is a great tool they talk about artist and design and david talk about review document but i can t rememb a time they ve talk about educ i m a colleg professor and use my ipad pro a much or more than my macbook pro at work or my imac at home in fact i m due for a comput upgrad at work and am serious consid ask for a desktop and let the ipad be my laptop what do i use the pencil for lot includ about the onli thing that make me nervou about use the ipad a my laptop is that i do a fair amount of work on other languag and ipad s keyboard support for altern languag at least the one i use is limit i love my ipad i love the big one long live the ipad i think appl ha approach incorrectli their messag with the ipad they promot that it can be a laptop replac a mistak it s sure a pc altern but i don t think appl ever call it a laptop replac i would be thrill if we could get zotero on the ipad get stuff into zotero from my ipad use the web interfac is non optim i know that he say for mani peopl but sinc the ipad pro appl share the messag that it replac a pc that includ a macbook with an ipad look at thi i think if you re look at a pc whi would you buy a pc anymor cook told in an interview no realli whi would you buy one cook insist that the ipad pro is a replac for a notebook or a desktop for mani mani peopl who will start use it and conclud they no longer need to use anyth el other than their phone the massiv ipad pro hit store on wednesday and at least one person believ it can replac the laptop that man just happen to be appl ceo ti i m a mac user and wa given a crappi dell by my employ last year our databas system crm and email are all web base so with a keyboard i wa abl to use my ipad pro to do most of my work i still use my laptop on occas for print via a privat network and is usual just store in my vehicl in case i use my ipad for photo video edit and note take it ha replac a laptop for me i still use my home mac on occas when i want the screen real estat but all my file are store in icloud or g drive or dropbox and i m abl to access portabl drive with the ipad i love thi thing and love the smart keyboard a well the biggest hurdl wa manag pdf s but i wa abl to fix that by use spark email and pdf expert it s not great that i have to pay mo for a good pdf solut but i ve been expens it and haven t been ask about it my cent endnot actual ha a great ipad app it offer a lot of great annot tool compar to other citat manag but the cite a you write function isn t that great such to the point that i end up back on my imac at work instead i agre about zotero it s a realli great commun built app and doe exactli what it s meant for and it would be great if there wa an ipad app that work with it i enjoy thi episod and it realli reson with me when david said that he doesn t want to fumbl with the dock and app layout in front of a client a most user in thi forum i d call myself quit tech savvi but when i m use my ipad in front of other i sometim get nervou i also think that it current is total overpow for the task most peopl throw at it if the price stay the same or even increas for thi year s gener of ipad pro i can t imagin a lot of peopl upgrad i d even say that a new gener of ipad pro will creat higher demand for the gener s model similar to the appl watch due to the then lower price i don t think that a singl year old interview respons count a appl s messag with the ipad i m right with you though i don t do much with video that s veri occasion for me i use goodnot and notabl for differ task if notabl would make three chang i d start do my goodnot task there i like notabl s interfac a lot better plu i don t have to tap the shape tool to auto draw shape an ipad pro includ is still not at the replac of a mac level sure it can cater to the need of an individu user develop but it ha it limit it super mobil other than that it still suffer from a desktop power mac in term of featur and oper system for someon in an enterpris softwar world use mac to develop softwar it still it s still a long way to go but i would love io or ipad o to get there a have an ipad is super mobil in and out of work i agre with cook that mani mani peopl peopl don t need a tradit comput anymor sale of laptop and desktop have been steadili declin for more than a decad while tablet sale remain pretti steadi and if you also count the million of student and other that use chromebook exclus it look like we have a signific percentag of the popul who haven t use a pc in year if ever i m retir but still do some consult and volunt work i have a mac mini for a home server but percent of my comput is io i use my ipad for my person comput a well a my consult some of my technic work is accomplish use other comput remot but that s also the way i work with my compani furnish laptop an ipad cannot replac everi laptop desktop ani more that pc mac are interchang but everi year more peopl are use someth other than a tradit comput at least for their person need power
